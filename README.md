# Optimization-Methods-in-ML
Implementation of various optimization algorithms like steepest gradient descent, Newton's method, conjugate gradient descent, quasi-newton method, etc., in C++.

## To Run
Download all the files in a single directory and run. (c++ compiler required)

## Note:
--> only works with two variable Quadratic Functions.<br>
--> To use for different Optimization functions you need to create new functions in `matrix.h` to support specific requirements.
